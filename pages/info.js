                <span className="font-bold">encryption</span> algorithms are
                used. There are two kinds of encryption algorithms, symmetric
                and also asymmetric ones. Symmetric algorithms allow encryption
                and decryption with the same key. With asymmetric algorithms you
                have to kinds of keys: a public one and also a private one. The
                public key is often available to the public while the private
                key is just available for &quot;yourself&quot; (if the mentioned
                keypair is yours). Everything that you encrypt with the public
                key can only be decrypted with the private one and vice versa.
                When it comes to confidentiality you often just use symmetric
                algorithms like DES, 3DES (both outdated) or AES. Asymmetric
                encryption is used to transfer a symmetric key and also to make
                sure that the other site is really who it seems to be (when it
                comes to SSL/TLS).

                is some concerns about the securtity of JWTs. Cookies can not be

                they are safer as long as your browser is not under attack. If
